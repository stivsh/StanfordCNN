This project contains realisation of algorithms from class
"Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition."

Directory linear_models contains realisations of LogisticRegression, SVM,
Multiclass SVM, SoftMax classifier.

Classifiers interface and common base classes such as:
  BaseBinaryLinearClassifier,
  BaseOneVersusAllLinearClassifier,
  BaseMultyClassClassifier,
described in linear_models/common.py.
To create classifier you needs to provide one of this base classes with 3 methods: h, j, dj.
First returns scores, second is the error function that must minimized
and the last is the gradient of j.
All other modules in this directory provides realization of this 3 methods
 depends on classifier type.
